# Preliminary Research

##### Stick in more stuff if you find it, just some general ideas to consider

## Algorithms


#### Algorithm name
___
**What it works on**
* lalala

**Rough Description Of How it works**
* lalala

**Key Features/Hyper parameters**
* lalal

**How training the model workds**
* lalal

**How does it work relative to datasize**
* lalal

## Metrics
#### Metric name
___
**What it meausers**
* lalal

**How its measured**
* lalal

## Datasets

#### Dataset title
___
**Description of dataset**
* lalal

**Layout of dataset**
* However's easiest (descriptive, table, image)


**Types of algorithms that can process it**
* Bit of a vague one but ya know, we need Datasets that we can use with our selected algorithm

**Possibilities to rank based on difficulty**
* Can be batched 'easy' 'medium' 'hard' etc...
* Or individually ranked from easy -> hard
* If unsure just stick it in anyways, we can talk about how to do it
